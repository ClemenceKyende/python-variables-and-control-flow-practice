# Variable Assignment & Arithmetic Operations
# Assigning values to variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Performing operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

# Printing results
print(f"The result of adding {a} and {b} is: {addition}")
print(f"The result of subtracting {b} from {a} is: {subtraction}")
print(f"The result of multiplying {a} by {b} is: {multiplication}")
print(f"The result of dividing {a} by {b} is: {division}")
